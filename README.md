#Mario-Style Platformer (C Language)

A classic Mario-inspired 2D platformer game built in C during Grade 11 as a school project.
This was one of my early deep dives into game logic, graphics handling, and structured programming.


##About The Game

This is a simple side-scrolling platformer where:
The player controls a Mario-style character
You can move left and right
Jump across platforms
Avoid obstacles
Reach the goal to win
It focuses on core game development concepts using pure C.


##What I Learned

Game loop logic
Collision detection
Basic physics (jumping & gravity simulation)
Structs and modular programming in C
Handling keyboard input
Managing game states (start, play, game over)
